## Research Experience

#### Undergraduate Research Project - University of Moratuwa (Sri Lanka)  `Feb 2020 - July 2021`

**Thesis Title**: Reconfigurable multimodal bio signal acquisition system for measuring endothelial function 
**Supervisor**: Dr. Anjula De Silva

The study focused on the use of bioimpedance to diagnose endothelial dysfunction. We created a novel device to record 4 biosignals, blood pressure, temperature, bioimpedance and PPG signals from a patient’s arm in order to compare the significance of bioimpedance compared to existing methods. A clinical study was carried out using the device and we were able to identify a significant difference between Type II Diabetes patients and healthy patients.
Technologies used: ESP32, C++, Altium, Python, MATLAB

#### Industrial Research Intern CSIRO - Data61 (Brisbane, Australia) `July 2019 – December 2019`

**Research Project**  - 3D SLAM (Spatial Localization And Mapping)  for robotics and situational awareness.
**Supervisors**: Michael Thoreau, Nick Panitz

This research focused on increasing worker safety on factory floors by providing situational awareness to robots and autonomous vehicles using security camera footage. A real-time 3D reconstruction of the factory was created from the video feed. I created an application for viewing and exploring the virtual environment. This was used by other researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of various computer vision algorithms and to demonstrate the research to clients for commercialization. I also worked on segmenting and classifying  objects in 3D space using machine learning models.
Technologies used: Python, JavaScript
